1. Make sure the actual file compiles by looking at test. If there is an error in test there is most likely a problem with the file itself.
2. After fixing all compilation errors, run the test file on eclipse by running file as junit test suite
3. for each failed test case identify the method being tested
4. go into the file and fix the method so that test case passes
